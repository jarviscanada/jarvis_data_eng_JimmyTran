summary: "I hold an Honours Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from Toronto Metropolitan University, complemented by a minor in economics and a software engineering concentration. Currently, I am a Software Developer at Jarvis Consulting, collaborating on diverse projects. In a previous role as a Software Engineer for a restaurant, I crafted impactful solutions like their website, Point of Sales system, and a Reservation Management web app. My passion lies in creating software that enhances everyday experiences, motivating my pursuit of a developer role. At Jarvis, I was able to gain experience with technologies like Linux/Bash, SQL, and Docker, complementing my expertise in JavaScript, HTML/CSS, React.js, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. Keen on continuous learning, I stay up to date with evolving tech trends. Outside work, I prioritize my well-being through exercise and enjoy board games or video games with friends."
