summary: "As a Computer Science graduate from Toronto Metropolitan University, I hold a minor in economics and specialize in software engineering. As a Software Developer at Jarvis Consulting, I actively cultivate my skills by tackling diverse and challenging projects. In a previous role, I developed impactful solutions to a restaurant's website, POS system, and Reservation Management app. My passion for problem-solving and commitment to continuous learning drive my pursuit of a developer role. At Jarvis, I've gained proficiency in technologies such as Linux/Bash, SQL, and Docker to complement my knowledge in JavaScript, HTML/CSS, React.js, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. Beyond work, I prioritize well-being through exercise and enjoy board and video games with friends."
