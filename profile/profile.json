The nodes specifically ran on CentOS 7 and used Bash/Shell scripts to obtain hardware info and resource usage. The information was stored in an RDBMS via a Docker and PostgreSQL instance. Crontab was used to automate the data collection and insertion into the SQL tables.",

This tool efficiently searches for a specified pattern within files and outputs lines containing that pattern. The implementation harnesses the power of Java 8 features, including Lambdas and the Stream API, making it a versatile and platform-independent solution for performing grep-like operations.",
