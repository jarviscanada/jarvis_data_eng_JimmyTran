  Ben. Why, Romeo, art thou mad?

    Now Romeo is belov'd, and loves again,
Enter Romeo alone.
  Ben. Romeo! my cousin Romeo! Romeo!
    Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover!
    O, Romeo, that she were, O that she were
    Romeo, good night. I'll to my truckle-bed;
Enter Romeo.
  Jul. O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?
    So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,
    Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name;
    Henceforth I never will be Romeo.  
    Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague?
    They say Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,
  Jul. Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.
  Jul. Hist! Romeo, hist! O for a falconer's voice  
    With repetition of my Romeo's name.
    Romeo!
  Jul. Romeo!
                        Enter Romeo.
    Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night.
  Mer. Where the devil should this Romeo be?

  Ben. Here comes Romeo! here comes Romeo!
    but not to the purpose. Signior Romeo, bon jour! There's a French

  Rom. I can tell you; but young Romeo will be older when you have
    Romeo, will you come to your father's? We'll to dinner thither.
    in the versal world. Doth not rosemary and Romeo begin both with
  Nurse. Ay, a thousand times. [Exit Romeo.] Peter!
    choose a man. Romeo? No, not he. Though his face be better than
  Jul. Here's such a coil! Come, what says Romeo?
Enter Friar [Laurence] and Romeo.
  Friar. Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.
  Tyb. Mercutio, thou consortest with Romeo.
                        Enter Romeo.
  Tyb. Romeo, the love I bear thee can afford
         Tybalt under Romeo's arm thrusts Mercutio in, and flies
  Ben. O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio's dead!
  Ben. Romeo, away, be gone!
                                                     Exit Romeo.
    There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,
  Ben. Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did stay.
    Romeo, that spoke him fair, bid him bethink
    Retorts it. Romeo he cries aloud,
    But by-and-by comes back to Romeo,
    And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.
    Romeo slew Tybalt; Romeo must not live.
  Prince. Romeo slew him; he slew Mercutio.
  Mon. Not Romeo, Prince; he was Mercutio's friend;
    Therefore use none. Let Romeo hence in haste,
    That runaway eyes may wink, and Romeo
    Come, night; come, Romeo; come, thou day in night;  
    Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,
    But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence.
    That Romeo bid thee fetch?
  Nurse. Romeo can,
    Though heaven cannot. O Romeo, Romeo!
    Who ever would have thought it? Romeo!
    Hath Romeo slain himself? Say thou but 'I,'
    And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!
    Is Romeo slaught'red, and is Tybalt dead?
  Nurse. Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished;
    Romeo that kill'd him, he is banished.
  Jul. O God! Did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?  
    Shame come to Romeo!  
    'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo- banished.'
    'Romeo is banished'- to speak that word
    Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,
    All slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished'-
    When theirs are dry, for Romeo's banishment.
    Both you and I, for Romeo is exil'd.
    And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!
  Nurse. Hie to your chamber. I'll find Romeo
    Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night.
  Friar. Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man.
                         Enter Romeo.
    But Romeo may not. More validity,  
    In carrion flies than Romeo. They may seize
    But Romeo may not- he is banished.
  Friar. Arise; one knocks. Good Romeo, hide thyself.
  Friar. Hark, how they knock! Who's there? Romeo, arise;
    Where is my lady's lord, where's Romeo?
    And Tybalt calls; and then on Romeo cries,
    Romeo is coming.
Enter Romeo and Juliet aloft, at the Window.
    Ere I again behold my Romeo!
  Lady. That same villain Romeo.
    With Romeo till I behold him- dead-
    That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,
    It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,
    Romeo is banish'd; and all the world to nothing
    Romeo's a dishclout to him. An eagle, madam,
    God join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;
    And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo's seal'd,
    Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift;
    Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.
    Because he married me before to Romeo?
    I wake before the time that Romeo
    And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?
    Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body
    Romeo, I come! this do I drink to thee.
Enter Romeo.
                Enter Romeo's Man Balthasar, booted.
    Welcome from Mantua. What says Romeo?
  Laur. Who bare my letter, then, to Romeo?
    She will beshrew me much that Romeo
    And keep her at my cell till Romeo come-
       Enter Romeo, and Balthasar with a torch, a mattock,
                                           Romeo opens the tomb.
  Bal. Romeo.
  Friar. Romeo!
    Romeo! O, pale! Who else? What, Paris too?
    And there I am. Where is my Romeo?
                                      [Snatches Romeo's dagger.]
                  She stabs herself and falls [on Romeo's body].
     Enter [some of the Watch,] with Romeo's Man [Balthasar].
  2. Watch. Here's Romeo's man. We found him in the churchyard.
  Wife. The people in the street cry 'Romeo,'
    And Romeo dead; and Juliet, dead before,
  Chief Watch. Here is a friar, and slaughter'd Romeo's man,
    Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;
    And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife.
    The form of death. Meantime I writ to Romeo
    Till I conveniently could send to Romeo.
    The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.
    Where's Romeo's man? What can he say in this?
  Cap. As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie-
    Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.
